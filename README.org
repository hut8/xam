* Introduction
XAM is a filesystem metadatabase. It allows you to query a set of files for their metadata, such as asking which files are a specific size or which match a given hash.

* Installation
If you would like to install it from source, make sure you have a working Go installation, then:

#+begin_src bash
go get github.com/hut8/xam
go install github.com/hut8/xam
#+end_src
